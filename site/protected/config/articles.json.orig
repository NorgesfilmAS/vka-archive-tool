The first way is to <strong>upload<\/strong> the file directly on the website, the other way is to use a FTP application to upload the file and then link the uploaded file to the specified Artwork.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Uploading with the browser<\/h3>\r\n<p>Normal file can be directly uploaded to the Artwork. Normal files are small (less the 128 MByte). These files are mostly previews, samples, images or documents belonging to the the Artwork. The upload process is easy. Just select the file and press Upload. A wait line will be shown during the process. After the upload the file is processed with ResourceSpace which still can take some time.<br \/> When the process is finished the preview is shown in the application<\/p>\r\n<h3>The file store<\/h3>\r\n<p>Because we are working with video, the size does matter. Original file can be huges. The upload system is limited to 128 MByte, so to upload files of 2 GByte (a normal uncompress video file) should be stored differently. Here the file store comes in handy<br \/> The file store is used for LARGE files, more the 128MByte. You just can not upload files beyond that size because the server (The apache server running the application) won&rsquo;t permit it. So for the original artwork you should use FTP. For this a FTP account is used at the office of PNEK. This FTP applciation can connect to the server and upload the file to the specified directory (Subdirectories are <strong>not<\/strong> allowed). If there is an hickup, the FTP application will continue the upload.<br \/> When upload they will be shown in the File store listbox. You can select the file and the file will be processed by Resource Space (it can take time for huge files) and the preview is shown.<br \/> Ofcause it is important that the name of the file has some logic to it. We propose the atleast the name of the Artist and the title of the Artwork are part of if. It would be handy if know to start the name is the id of the Artwork.<br \/> The file store is also used to restore a deleted or overwritten file. The restore file will be places in the File Store so you can link it back to some Artwork.

You can open an existing report by clicking on the name. A new screen is opened. The left side of screen is used to filter the record for report. The right side of the screen is used to show the informatie selected.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Filtering record<\/h3>\r\n<p>To limit the information select you can use the filter function. The filter will combine the question and will show only the records that comply to all the conditions (it's an AND construction). The first character of the filter field will define how the value will be compared to the field. You can use:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>= exact<\/li>\r\n<li>&gt; larger<\/li>\r\n<li>&gt;= larger or equal<\/li>\r\n<li>&lt; less<\/li>\r\n<li>&lt;= less or equal<\/li>\r\n<li>% contains<\/li>\r\n<li>$ begins with<\/li>\r\n<li>! does not contain<\/li>\r\n<li>- range.

The <strong>Export<\/strong> button will be enabled after you have pressed the <strong>Run selection<\/strong> button. Changing anything will disable the <strong>Export<\/strong> button again.

You can order the record <strong>ascending<\/strong> or&nbsp;<strong>descending<\/strong> or you can&nbsp;<strong>group<\/strong> the information. To add a new order\/group you click the + of one of the available fields. You can select multiple fields. The sorting will be first on the first field and within the first field it will sort on the second field.

Header fields are fields that are display when the value of the group changes. Like when changing the decenia from the 80 to the 90, you can print this in the header. Some of the fields in the grouping are special, like the <strong>count<\/strong> of records in the group, or the <strong>total time<\/strong> the group occupies. The fields will placed in the final report in the order they are added.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Fields in the report<\/h3>\r\n<p>The lower part of the designer is used to define which fields will be shown in the record.

The first way is to <strong>upload<\/strong> the file directly on the website, the other way is to use a FTP application to upload the file and then link the uploaded file to the specified Artwork.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Uploading with the browser<\/h3>\r\n<p>Normal file can be directly uploaded to the Artwork. Normal files are small (less the 128 MByte). These files are mostly previews, samples, images or documents belonging to the the Artwork. The upload process is easy. Just select the file and press Upload. A wait line will be shown during the process. After the upload the file is processed with ResourceSpace which still can take some time.<br \/> When the process is finished the preview is shown in the application<\/p>\r\n<h3>The file store<\/h3>\r\n<p>Because we are working with video, the size does matter. Original file can be huges. The upload system is limited to 128 MByte, so to upload files of 2 GByte (a normal uncompress video file) should be stored differently. Here the file store comes in handy<br \/> The file store is used for LARGE files, more the 128MByte. You just can not upload files beyond that size because the server (The apache server running the application) won&rsquo;t permit it. So for the original artwork you should use FTP. For this a FTP account is used at the office of PNEK. This FTP applciation can connect to the server and upload the file to the specified directory (Subdirectories are <strong>not<\/strong> allowed). If there is an hickup, the FTP application will continue the upload.<br \/> When upload they will be shown in the File store listbox. You can select the file and the file will be processed by Resource Space (it can take time for huge files) and the preview is shown.<br \/> Ofcause it is important that the name of the file has some logic to it. We propose the atleast the name of the Artist and the title of the Artwork are part of if. It would be handy if know to start the name is the id of the Artwork.<br \/> The file store is also used to restore a deleted or overwritten file. The restore file will be places in the File Store so you can link it back to some Artwork. (The restore of deleted files is under System \/ Delete files).<\/p>","className":"","groups":null,"showGeneral":"1","showModerator":null,"showAdmin":"0"},"3269562684":{"id":3269562684,"title":"Revisions & Versions","key":"revisions","content":"<h2>Version 1.30<\/h2>\r\n<p>Add multiple artist create one artwork<\/p>\r\n<table style=\"width: 100%; float: left;\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>V1.30.02<\/td>\r\n<td>Mrt 9, 2015<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fix: Art model saving with a single Artist throws an error<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>V1.30.01<\/td>\r\n<td>Feb 27, 2015<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>not<\/strong>: when adding an artwork only one artist can be select.
