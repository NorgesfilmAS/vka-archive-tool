The first way is to <strong>upload<\/strong> the file directly on the website, the other way is to use a FTP application to upload the file and then link the uploaded file to the specified Artwork.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Uploading with the browser<\/h3>\r\n<p>Normal file can be directly uploaded to the Artwork. Normal files are small (less the 128 MByte). These files are mostly previews, samples, images or documents belonging to the the Artwork. The upload process is easy. Just select the file and press Upload. A wait line will be shown during the process. After the upload the file is processed with ResourceSpace which still can take some time.<br \/> When the process is finished the preview is shown in the application<\/p>\r\n<h3>The file store<\/h3>\r\n<p>Because we are working with video, the size does matter. Original file can be huges. The upload system is limited to 128 MByte, so to upload files of 2 GByte (a normal uncompress video file) should be stored differently. Here the file store comes in handy<br \/> The file store is used for LARGE files, more the 128MByte. You just can not upload files beyond that size because the server (The apache server running the application) won&rsquo;t permit it. So for the original artwork you should use FTP. For this a FTP account is used at the office of PNEK. This FTP applciation can connect to the server and upload the file to the specified directory (Subdirectories are <strong>not<\/strong> allowed). If there is an hickup, the FTP application will continue the upload.<br \/> When upload they will be shown in the File store listbox. You can select the file and the file will be processed by Resource Space (it can take time for huge files) and the preview is shown.<br \/> Ofcause it is important that the name of the file has some logic to it. We propose the atleast the name of the Artist and the title of the Artwork are part of if. It would be handy if know to start the name is the id of the Artwork.<br \/> The file store is also used to restore a deleted or overwritten file. The restore file will be places in the File Store so you can link it back to some Artwork. (The restore of deleted files is under System \/ Delete files).<\/p>","className":"","groups":null,"showGeneral":"1","showModerator":null,"showAdmin":"0"},"3269562684":{"id":3269562684,"title":"Revisions & Versions","key":"revisions","content":"<h2>Version 1.10<\/h2>\r\n<p>Add moderation and usermanager<\/p>\r\n<table style=\"width: 100%; float: left;\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>v1.10.10<\/td>\r\n<td>May 26 2014<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>fixed bug in setup that it forgot the previous stored settings<\/li>\r\n<li>fixed bug in ProcessingJob the client config<\/li>\r\n<li>fixed bug in Run process (forgot id)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>v1.10.09<\/td>\r\n<td>May 20 2014<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Added the work count in the Artist menu<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>v1.10.08<\/td>\r\n<td>May 19 2014<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add revisions documentation<\/li>\r\n<li>fix overwrite of local configuration<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>v1.10.07<\/td>\r\n<td>May 19 2014<\/td>\r\n<td>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fix of dates changes in Chrome<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/td>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","className":"","groups":null,"showGeneral":"0","showModerator":null,"showAdmin":"0"},"4152219207":{"id":4152219207,"title":"Licensed under MIT","key":"copyright","content":"<p>Copyright (c) 2013-2014 Toxus, The Netherlands (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.toxus.nl\">www.toxus.nl<\/a>)<\/p>\r\n<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br \/>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and\/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<\/p>\r\n<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
