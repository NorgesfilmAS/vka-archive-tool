  When searching for a specific Art work or Artist, the searchbox on left can be used to combine the
  criteria. The information enter is combined into one search question in which all conditions must be true<br/>
  So when looking for information like <b>Artist</b> is "niels" and <b>year</b> is "1990", we are looking for all
  artwork made by every artist whose name contains <b>niels</b> and was made in <b>1990</b>. To select all works made
  after 1990 we use the the comparing instruction to preceed the value. So if we want to select every artwork
  that has been made after 1990, we should enter: <b>year</b> is "&gt;1990". The possible compare options are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>&lt;</code> the field must be less than the given value.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;=</code> the field must be less than or equal to the given value.</li>
    <li><code>&gt;=</code> the field must be greater than or equal to the given value.</li>
    <li><code>&gt;</code> the field must be greater than to the given value.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;&gt;</code> the field must be equal to the given value</li>
  </ul>
